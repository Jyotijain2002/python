'''
in linear regression the features are linear so we try to fiut a straight line into the data
but 
what if the features or data are non linear or a combination of features
for example housing price do not tend to be linear with area(x*x)
for that we need polynomial regression with helps us to fit the curves into the data with non linear features

Note the value of  𝐰
 , [0.08 0.54 0.03] and b is 0.0106.This implies the model after fitting/training is:
0.08𝑥+0.54𝑥2+0.03𝑥3+0.0106
 
Gradient descent has emphasized the data that is the best fit to the  𝑥2
  data by increasing the  𝑤1
  term relative to the others. If you were to run for a very long time, it would continue to reduce the impact of the other terms.

Gradient descent is picking the 'correct' features for us by emphasizing its associated parameter

Let's review this idea:

less weight value implies less important/correct feature, and in extreme, when the weight becomes zero or very close to zero, the associated feature is not useful in fitting the model to the data.
above, after fitting, the weight associated with the  𝑥2
  feature is much larger than the weights for  𝑥
  or  𝑥3
  as it is the most useful in fitting the data.

'''
Above, polynomial features were chosen based on how well they matched the target data. Another way to think about this is to note that we are still using linear regression once we have created new features. Given that, the best features will be linear relative to the target. This is best understood with an example.
Above, it is clear that the  𝑥2
  feature mapped against the target value  𝑦
  is linear. Linear regression can then easily generate a model using that feature.

#scaling features
'''
x,x^2,x^3 will have different scales, so we need to do feature scaling to find the gradient descent fast, so lets apply z-score normalization
'''

x=np.arange(0,20,1)
X=np.c_[x,x**2,x**3]
print(f'peek to peek range by column in raw   X:{np.ptp(X,axis=0)}')

# add normalization
X=zscore_normalize_features(X)
print(f'peak to peak range by column in normalized X: {np.ptp(X,axis=0)}')

# after normalization we can try again with more aggressive value of alpha

model_w,model_b= run_gradient_descent_feng(X,y,100000,1e-1)

plt.scatter(x,y,marker='x',c='r',label='actual value')

'''
Feature scaling allows this to converge much faster.
Note again the values of  𝐰
 . The  𝑤1
  term, which is the  𝑥2
  term is the most emphasized. Gradient descent has all but eliminated the  𝑥3
  term.
